The result is a valid Python expression. If x is not a Python int object, it has to define an __index__() method that returns an integer.'),('bool([x])','Convert a value to a Boolean, using the standard truth testing procedure. If x is false or omitted, this returns False; otherwise it returns True. bool is also a class, which is a subclass of int. Class bool cannot be subclassed further. Its only instances are False and True'),('bytearray([source[, encoding[, errors]]])','Return a new array of bytes. The bytearray type is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. It has most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, described in Mutable Sequence Types, as well as most methods that the str type has, see String Methods.'),('callable(object)','Return True if the object argument appears callable, False if not. If this returns true, it is still possible that a call fails, but if it is false, calling object will never succeed. Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance); class instances are callable if they have a __call__() method.'),('classmethod(function)','Return a class method for function.A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance.'),('cmp(x, y)','Compare the two objects x and y and return an integer according to the outcome. The return value is negative if x < y, zero if x == y and strictly positive if x > y.'),('compile(source, filename, mode[, flags])','Compile the source into a code or AST object. Code objects can be executed by an exec statement or evaluated by a call to eval(). source can either be a string or an AST object.'),('complex([real[, imag]])','Compile the source into a code or AST object. Code objects can be executed by an exec statement or evaluated by a call to eval(). source can either be a string or an AST object. Refer to the ast module documentation for information on how to work with AST objects.'),('delattr(object, name)','This is a relative of setattr(). The arguments are an object and a string. The string must be the name of one of the object’s attributes. The function deletes the named attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, delattr(x, \'foobar\') is equivalent to del x.foobar.'),('dict([arg])','Create a new data dictionary, optionally with items taken from arg. The dictionary type is described in Mapping Types — dict.For other containers see the built in list, set, and tuple classes, and the collections module.'),('dir([object])','Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object.'),('divmod(a, b)','Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using long division. With mixed operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For plain and long integers, the result is the same as (a // b, a % b). '),('enumerate(sequence[, start=0])','Return an enumerate object. sequence must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object which supports iteration. The next() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the corresponding value obtained from iterating over iterable.'),('eval(expression[, globals[, locals]])','The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals. If provided, globals must be a dictionary. If provided, locals can be any mapping object.'),('execfile(filename[, globals[, locals]])','This function is similar to the exec statement, but parses a file instead of a string. It is different from the import statement in that it does not use the module administration — it reads the file unconditionally and does not create a new module.'),('file(filename[, mode[, bufsize]])','Constructor function for the file type, described further in section File Objects. The constructor’s arguments are the same as those of the open() built-in function described below.'),('filter(function, iterable)','Construct a list from those elements of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If iterable is a string or a tuple, the result also has that type; otherwise it is always a list.'),('format(value[, format_spec])','Convert a value to a “formatted” representation, as controlled by format_spec. The interpretation of format_spec will depend on the type of the value argument, however there is a standard formatting syntax that is used by most built-in types: Format Specification Mini-Language.'),('frozenset([iterable])','Return a frozenset object, optionally with elements taken from iterable. The frozenset type is described in Set Types — set, frozenset.For other containers see the built in dict, list, and tuple classes, and the collections module.'),('getattr(object, name[, default])','Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the object’s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. '),('globals()','Return a dictionary representing the current global symbol table. This is always the dictionary of the current module (inside a function or method, this is the module where it is defined, not the module from which it is called).'),('hasattr(object, name)','Return the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers. They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup. Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0).'),('hash(object)','Return the hash value of the object (if it has one).

The result is a valid Python expression.'),('id(object)','Return the “identity” of an object.

Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.'),('input([prompt])','Equivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt)).'),('int([x[, base]])','Convert a string or number to a plain integer. If the argument is a string, it must contain a possibly signed decimal number representable as a Python integer, possibly embedded in whitespace.

Also return true if classinfo is a type object (new-style class) and object is an object of that type or of a (direct or indirect) subclass thereof.'),('issubclass(class, classinfo)','Return true if class is a subclass (direct or indirect) of classinfo. A class is considered a subclass of itself. classinfo may be a tuple of class objects, in which case every entry in classinfo will be checked. In any other case, a TypeError exception is raised.'),('iter(o[, sentinel])','Return an iterator object. The first argument is interpreted very differently depending on the presence of the second argument. Without a second argument, o must be a collection object which supports the iteration protocol (the __iter__() method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0).'),('list([iterable])','Return a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable‘s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:]. For instance, list(\'abc\') returns [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3].

Free variables are returned by locals() when it is called in function blocks, but not in class blocks.Update and return a dictionary更新和返回字典'),('long([x[, base]])','Convert a string or number to a long integer. If the argument is a string, it must contain a possibly signed number of arbitrary size, possibly embedded in whitespace. The base argument is interpreted in the same way as for int(), and may only be given when x is a string.'),('map(function, iterable, ...)','Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results. If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel. If one iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with None items.'),('max(iterable[, args...][, key])','With a single argument iterable, return the largest item of a non-empty iterable (such as a string, tuple or list). With more than one argument, return the largest of the arguments.The optional key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort(). The key argument, if supplied, must be in keyword form (for example, max(a,b,c,key=func)).'),('memoryview(obj)','Return a “memory view” object created from the given argument. See memoryview type for more information.'),('min(iterable[, args...][, key])','With a single argument iterable, return the smallest item of a non-empty iterable (such as a string, tuple or list).

It has the methods that are common to all instances of new style classes.'),('oct(x)','Convert an integer number (of any size) to an octal string. The result is a valid Python expression.'),('open(filename[, mode[, bufsize]])','Open a file, returning an object of the file type described in section File Objects. If the file cannot be opened, IOError is raised. When opening a file, it’s preferable to use open() instead of invoking the file constructor directly.'),('ord(c)','Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string. For example, ord(\'a\') returns the integer 97, ord(u\'\\u2020\') returns 8224.'),('pow(x, y[, z])','Return x to the power y; if z is present, return x to the power y, modulo z (computed more efficiently than pow(x, y) % z). The two-argument form pow(x, y) is equivalent to using the power operator: x**y.'),('print([object, ...][, sep=\' \'])','Print object(s) to the stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end and file, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.'),('property([fget[, fset[, fdel[, doc]]]])','Return a property attribute for new-style classes (classes that derive from object).'),('range([start], stop[, step])','起始位置，终止位置，步长'),('raw_input([prompt])','If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline.'),('reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])','Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).'),('reload(module)','重载模块，很重要的函数'),('repr(object)','Return a string containing a printable representation of an object. This is the same value yielded by conversions (reverse quotes). It is sometimes useful to be able to access this operation as an ordinary function.'),('reversed(seq)','Return a reverse iterator. seq must be an object which has a __reversed__() method or supports the sequence protocol (the __len__() method and the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0).'),('round(x[, n])','Return the floating point value x rounded to n digits after the decimal point. If n is omitted, it defaults to zero. The result is a floating point number. Values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus n; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done away from 0 (so. for example, round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0).'),('set([iterable])','Return a new set, optionally with elements taken from iterable. The set type is described in Set Types — set, frozenset.'),('setattr(object, name, value)','This is the counterpart of getattr(). The arguments are an object, a string and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, setattr(x, \'foobar\', 123) is equivalent to x.foobar = 123.'),('slice([start], stop[, step])','Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step). The start and step arguments default to None. Slice objects have read-only data attributes start, stop and step which merely return the argument values (or their default).'),('sorted(iterable[, cmp[, key[, reverse]]])','Return a new sorted list from the items in iterable.'),('staticmethod(function)','Return a static method for function.'),('str([object])','Return a string containing a nicely printable representation of an object. For strings, this returns the string itself. The difference with repr(object) is that str(object) does not always attempt to return a string that is acceptable to eval(); its goal is to return a printable string.'),('sum(iterable[, start])','Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. start defaults to 0. The iterable‘s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.'),('super(type[, object-or-type])','Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The search order is same as that used by getattr() except that the type itself is skipped.'),('tuple([iterable])','Return a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable‘s items. iterable may be a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For instance, tuple(\'abc\') returns (\'a\', \'b\', \'c\') and tuple([1, 2, 3]) returns (1, 2, 3).

The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an object.'),('unichr(i)','Return the Unicode string of one character whose Unicode code is the integer i. For example, unichr(97) returns the string u\'a\'. This is the inverse of ord() for Unicode strings.

This is an opaque sequence type which yields the same values as the corresponding list, without actually storing them all simultaneously.'),('zip([iterable, ...])','NULL'),('__import__(name[, globals[, locals]])','This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming.This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced (by importing the __builtin__ module and assigning to __builtin__.__import__) in order to change semantics of the import statement, but nowadays it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302).');
